Procedure LINEAR SEARCH(a,x):

Inputs:
	a: the array to search in
	x: the value we are searching for in a 
	
Outputs:
	The index position where a[i] = x or -1 if not found.
	
1) Set answer to -1.
2) For each index i going from 1 to n, in order
	If a[i] = x, then set answer to the value of i.
3) Return the value of answer as the output.

Big O notation: O(n).


Procedure RECURSIVE LINEAR SEARCH(A, i, x):

Inputs: Same as above but with added parameter i.
Output: The index of an element matching x in the subarray form A[i] 
		Through A[n] or -1 if x is not found in the array.
		
1) If i > n, then return -1.
2) Else if A[i] == x, then return i.
3) Else return  RECURSIVE LINEAR SEARCH(A, i + 1, x).
